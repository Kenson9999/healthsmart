                    obesity. BMI was first developed by a scientist in 1832, then renamed “body mass index” in
                    1974. Today, BMI is used to define if a person has overweight and obesity. These are
                    conditions where someone’s weight is greater than what is deemed to be a normal or healthy
                    weight.</h4>

                <h4>Screening for excess weight is important because having too much fat in our bodies increases
                    our health risks. BMI can help you and your healthcare provider determine if your weight is
                    risky to your health. Having a BMI that is too high can put you at greater risk for certain
                    diseases, like heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Research over many years has shown that
                    health complications increase as BMI increases.</h4>
